# Is It Up Yet?

A simple C++ program which obsessively checks a thing (e.g. wi-fi SSID broadcasts), and let's you know when it's up.

## The "Command" Repo

This is a simple BASH command wrapper I wrote in C, which allows you to execute BASH commands from within your C/C++ program. "Is It Up Yet?" uses this extensively, and you will be required to clone this repo into here before you can compile it. To do so, simply navigate to the /src dir of this repo and use git clone to clone the "Command" repo into this one, then run the make file. Couldn't be easier.
